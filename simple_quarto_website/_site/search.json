    "text": "This is a Quarto website. I am now realizing that doing the lab before the homework is due is very helpful because you get a basic understanding on how to make a quarto website which is what the HW asks you to do at the end to display your results!! If I did this assignment before I finished HW1, then I would have done HW1 at the speed of light!\nThe speed of light in a vacuum is \\(C=\\lambda f\\) Speaking of light, how to estimate the value of dark matter using simulations is cited Perez et al. (2023).\n\n\n\n“You are so right.” A line i hear often from my parents, sister, friends and family.\n\nHere is a list of things fun facts about me:\n\nI am very tall for a girl I guess? I’m 5’10 and everyone tells me how I’m so tall and should play basketball/volleyball (I don’t like competitive sports, they stress me out)\nI love football, I love watching football and now that I turnt 21, it’s even funner because sports bars are a thing! I do wish that football culture was bigger here like similar level to Europe.\nI am trilingual! I speak French, English and Creole. I speak Spanish too a lil and can get around since it’s so similar to French and I also studied Spanish for 5 years.\n\n\n\n\n\nColumn 1 (In bold because it is very important)\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Donec quote and BIG text.\n\nColumn 2 (italic for funsies)\nCurabitur blandit tempus porttitor.
