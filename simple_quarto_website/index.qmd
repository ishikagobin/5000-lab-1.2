# Introduction to Lab 3

This is a Quarto website. I am now realizing that doing the lab before the homework is due is very helpful because you get a basic understanding on how to make a quarto website which is what the HW asks you to do at the end to display your results!!
If I did this assignment before I finished HW1, then I would have done HW1 at the speed of light!

The speed of light in a vacuum is $C=\lambda f$
Speaking of light, how to estimate the value of dark matter using simulations is cited @Perez2023CAMELSSAM. 

## Main Body of Lab 3 

> "You are so right." A line i hear often from my parents, sister, friends and family. 

Here is a list of things fun facts about me:

- I am very tall for a girl I guess? I'm 5'10 and everyone tells me how I'm so tall and should play basketball/volleyball (I don't like competitive sports, they stress me out)

- I love football, I love watching football and now that I turnt 21, it's even funner because sports bars are a thing! I do wish that football culture was bigger here like similar level to Europe. 

- I am trilingual! I speak French, English and Creole. I speak Spanish too a lil and can get around since it's so similar to French and I also studied Spanish for 5 years.
